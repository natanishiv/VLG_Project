# Fake Image Detection using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression Model


## Introduction
This project aims to detect fake images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) using two different models: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used for training consists of 1200 features, on which Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and preprocessing techniques were applied. The trained models were evaluated using various performance metrics, including the F1 score for the training data. Additionally, an accuracy curve was plotted by varying the hyperparameters of the models.

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this project contains a total of 1200 features that were extracted from images. Each feature represents a specific characteristic or attribute of an image, which is essential for identifying fake images generated by AI. Prior to training the models, the dataset underwent PCA to reduce the dimensionality and preprocessing techniques to ensure optimal model performance.

## Results
After training the ANN and Logistic Regression models, the accuracy of the ANN model was found to be higher compared to the Logistic Regression model. The accuracy metric provides a measure of the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
Overall, the results demonstrate that the ANN model outperformed the Logistic Regression model in terms of accuracy. The combination of advanced machine learning techniques, PCA preprocessing, and the ANN architecture allowed for effective detection of fake images generated by AI. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and ensure the authenticity of visual content.
